    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Margherita Pizza is a beloved Italian pizza that features a thin, crisp crust topped with a simple tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fragrant basil leaves. Baked to perfection, the cheese melts into the sauce, creating a deliciously gooey topping that pairs beautifully with the fresh basil. Drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper, this pizza is a classic that highlights the beauty of simple, high-quality ingredients.</p>
